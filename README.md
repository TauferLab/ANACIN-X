## Introduction

Non-deterministic results often arise unexpectedly in High Performance Computing (HPC) applications.  These make reproducible and correct results difficult to create.  As such, there is a need to improve the ability of software developers and scientists to comprehend root sources of non-determinism in their applications.  To this end, we present ANACIN-X.

This repository contains a suite of tools for trace-based analysis of non-deterministic behavior in MPI applications. The core components of this tool suite are as follows.  
* A Framework for Characterizing Root Sources of Non-Determinism as Graph Similarity: This is broken down into the following stages
  1. Execution Trace Collection
  2. Event Graph Construction
  3. Event Graph Kernel Analysis
  4. Kernel Distance Visualization
* Use Case Communication Patterns

The best way to learn more details on how ANACIN-X works is to see either the [Software Overview](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Software-Overview) page on the ANACIN-X wiki or review the [publications](#publications) listed at the bottom of this README.

## **Installation**

Here, we outline the procedure to install ANACIN-X and its dependencies.  

For more details about the information in this section, please see the [wiki page on 'Installation'](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Installation).  A complete list of software dependencies for ANACIN-X can be found at the ['Dependencies' wiki page](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Dependencies).

**We strongly recommend installing the Spack and Conda package managers before installing ANACIN-X**.  We use these to help automate the installation of dependencies.

### Dependencies

Once you have cloned the ANACIN-X repository to your local machine, be sure to enter the project root for setup.

If you're using the  [Jetstream cloud computer](https://jetstream-cloud.org) image for Anacin-X titled ["Ubuntu20.04_Anacin-X"](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/1056), you can skip this next command.  Otherwise, we strongly recommend installing the dependencies for the project with the following command.  

```
. setup_deps.sh
``` 

If you will use this command to install dependencies, be sure to have the Spack and Conda package managers set up beforehand.  If there is a specific C compiler that you wish to use on your machine, please see the ['Special Case' section](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Installation#special-case) of the ANACIN-X wiki.

Follow the prompts at the beginning, and then the installation will run on its own.  The installation of dependencies may take some time to complete.

If you will install the dependencies of ANACIN-X manually, see the following list of them here, or see a more detailed list on the [ANACIN-X wiki](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Dependencies).

### Building ANACIN-X

Once all dependenices are installed and loaded, build ANACIN-X and its submodules by running

```
. setup.sh -c
```

If you do not wish to build ANACIN-X with callstack tracing functionality, remove the '-c' in the above command.


## **Running ANACIN-X**:

For more details on running ANACIN-X than what can be found in this README, see the ['Running ANACIN-X'](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Running-ANACIN-X) wiki page.

ANACIN-X must be run alongside another application.  We divide this into two categories:
* Run ANACIN-X with one of three benchmark applications packaged within this repository.
* Run ANACIN-X with an external application (e.g., a user defined communication pattern such as MiniAMR or MCB Grid).

### Running ANACIN-X on a Benchmark Application

Use the 'comm\_pattern\_analysis.sh' script to generate traces of a selected benchmark communication pattern and perform analysis on the event graphs.

The following command line switches can be used to define parameters for your job submission.  More details for each, such as constraints and default values, can be found in the [ANACIN-X wiki](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Running-ANACIN-X#running-anacin-x-with-a-benchmark-application)
* `-p`        : Defines the size of the mpi communicator (number of MPI processes)
* `-i`        : Defines the number of times a benchmark communication pattern appears in a single execution of ANACIN-X. 
* `-s`        : The size in bytes of the messages passed when generating communication patterns.
* `-n`        : The number of compute nodes requested for running the ANACIN-X workflow. 
* `-r`        : The number of runs to make of the ANACIN-X workflow.
* `-cp`       : Used to define the communication pattern benchmark for testing. (i.e., message_race, amg2013, or unstructured_mesh)
* `-sc`      : Used to define which schedule system is currently in use. (i.e., lsf, slurm, or unscheduled)
* `-ct`       : Used to define which backtracing tool should be used during callstack tracing. (i.e., glibc or libunwind)
* `-o`        : Used to define a custom path to store output from the project. 
* `-nd`       : Takes 3 arguments in decimal format (start percent, step size, end percent) to define message non-determinism percentages present in the final data.
* `-nt`       : When running the unstructured mesh communication pattern, takes the percentage of topological non-determinism in decimal format.
* `-c`        : When running the unstructured mesh communication pattern, takes 3 arguments (integers greater than 1) to define the grid coordinates.
* `-v`        : If used, will display the execution settings prior to running the execution.
* `-h`        : Used to display the list of switch options.

If you're running on a system that uses the Slurm scheduler, then the following switches can be used to define settings for job submission:
* `-q`       : Defines the queue to submit scheduled jobs to. (Defaults to the "normal" queue)
* `-t`        : A maximum time limit in minutes on the time provided to jobs submitted. (Default 10 minutes)
                

If the project is run with settings that are too small, then the communication pattern generated may not end up being non-deterministic.  A few things can be done to increase the odds of inducing non-determinism in a simulation:
* It is good to run on a large number of processes (at least 10 using the `-p` flag) and a large number of runs (at least 50) to increase the odds of non-determinism arising.
* By running a communication pattern with multiple iterations (using the `-i` flag), the user can cause more non-determinism.  This is particularly important when running the message race communication pattern.
* Running with a small message size (using the `-s` flag) can increase the likelihood of non-determinism.
* Running the program across multiple compute nodes (using the `-n` flag) can help to cause more non-determinism.

Below is an example run of the script as one might submit it to run message\_race on an unscheduled system.

```
. ./comm_pattern_analysis.sh -p 20 -i 10 -n 1 -v -r 100 -sc unscheduled -cp message_race -o $HOME/message_race_sim_1
```

Below is another example run of the script as one might submit it on the Stampede2 cluster computer to analyze the AMG 2013 communication pattern:

```
. ./comm_pattern_analysis.sh -p 48 -n 2 -v -r 50 -sq "skx-normal" -sc slurm -cp amg2013 -o $WORK2/anacinx_output_1
```

Be sure to check that the settings you run with will work on the system you use.  If you request too many resources or too many jobs, the code may error out.

### Running ANACIN-X on an External Application

If you're running ANACIN-X with an external application, you will need to run the stages of it individually.  We will outline here how to run the stages:
* [Execution Trace Collection](#execution-trace-collection)
* [Event Graph Construction](#event-graph-construction)
* [Event Graph Kernel Analysis](#event-graph-kernel-analysis)

For more details about running these sections, please see the wiki page section on ['Running ANACIN-X with an External Application'](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Running-ANACIN-X#running-anacin-x-with-an-external-application).

#### Execution Trace Collection

To trace the execution of an application, ANACIN-X relies on the following three MPI profiling interface (PMPI) tools
* [sst-dumpi](https://github.com/TauferLab/sst-dumpi/tree/b47bb77ccbe3b87d585e3701e1a5c2f8d3626176)
* [Pluto](https://github.com/TauferLab/Pluto/tree/main)
* [CSMPI](https://github.com/TauferLab/CSMPI/tree/367a1c3bdba1511ad5d415daecf714ea01c536c6)

Be sure to configure and link all the PMPI tools prior to tracing.  See their respective GitHub pages linked above.  PnMPI will need to be configured to use the linked modules.  See the PnMPI [GitHub page](https://github.com/LLNL/PnMPI/tree/f6fcc801ab9305352c510420c6439b7d48a248dc) for more information on linking software and configuring PnMPI.

The command to trace your application will look something like:

```
LD_PRELOAD=<libpnmpi.so path> PNMPI_LIB_PATH=<pnmpi linking directory> PNMPI_CONF=<pnmpi config directory> mpirun -np P E A

Positional Arguments:
P    Number of MPI processes requested
E    Application executable to be traced
A    Arguments to traced application
```

You will need to run the above command many times to produce a sample of traces.  The traces across runs will be compared in subsequent stages.  

Be sure to configure each of the PMPI tools to store their output for a single run in the same directory.  We will call it a 'run directory'.  Suppose you make 100 runs of your application.  There should then be 100 'run directories' adjacent to each other, each one storing all the trace files from a run.

#### Event Graph Construction

After creating traces for many runs of your application, a graph must be constructed for each run from those traces.  We will use the [dumpi_to_graph](https://github.com/TauferLab/dumpi_to_graph/tree/3966d25a916ddf0cd5e4e71ce71702798c0f39e1) software package to convert execution traces into event graphs.

Please see the dumpi_to_graph [GitHub page](https://github.com/TauferLab/dumpi_to_graph/tree/3966d25a916ddf0cd5e4e71ce71702798c0f39e1) to create a configuration file for your needs, using the examples that dumpi_to_graph provides as a reference.

Once you have configured dumpi_to_graph, use a command from the projects root directory of the following form to construct an event graph from the traces within one run directory.

```
mpirun -np P dE dC R

Positional Arguments:
P    Number of MPI processes requested
dE   dumpi_to_graph executable file (should be found in dumpi_to_graphs build directory)
dC   dumpi_to_graph configuration file (likely found in dumpi_to_graphs config directory)
R    Path to a directory storing traces (i.e., a run directory)
```

The above command must be run for each run directory.  An event graph will be stored in each run directory that the above command is used on.

#### Event Graph Kernel Analysis

First select a slicing policy file from the 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/slicing_policies' directory.  Each one will break the graph up into components based on different functions or data and may be relevant to different applications.  If your application uses barriers, we recommend using one of the slicing policy files with 'barrier_delimited_' in the title.

Once you have decided on a slicing policy to use, run the following command separately on each event graph to perform slice extraction for each event graph.

```
mpirun -np P anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/extract_slice.py EG SP -o "slices"

Positional Arguments:
P    Number of MPI processes requested
EG   An event graph file (graphml) from one run directory
SP   Slicing policy file found in the 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/slicing_policies' directory
```

To run event graph kernel calculations, first select a graph kernel policy file 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/graph_kernel_policies' directory.  We suggest using the file 'wlst_5iters_logical_timestamp_label.json'.

Then run the following command to generate kernel distance data.

```
mpirun -np P anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/compute_kernel_distance_time_series.py T KP --slicing_policy SP -o "kdts.pkl" --slice_dir_name "slices" [-c]

Positional Arguments:
P    Number of MPI processes requested
T    Directory storing all run directories
KP   Graph kernel policy file found in the 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/graph_kernel_policies' directory
SP   Slicing policy file found in the 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/slicing_policies' directory

Options:
-c   Include this if you traced your application with CSMPI to collect callstack data
```

Unlike the previous stages of the workflow, the kernel calculation command above only takes place once for all runs of the traced application.

## **Result Visualization**: 

For more details on visualizing ANACIN-X data beyond what is described here, see the ['Visualization'](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Visualization) wiki page.

For demonstration purposes, we provide the user with sample KDTS data within the ANACIN-X project under the sub-directory 'sample_kdts'.  The user has the option to visualzie the provided sample results or to visualize their own generated results.  Note that callstack visualization will not work for sample data.  Commands for running sample data can be found in the section below on ['Visualizing Benchmark Application Data'](#visualizing-benchmark-application-data).

### Visualizing Benchmark Application Data

Throughout this, you can view the ANACIN-X wiki section on ['Benchmark Application Data Visualization'](https://github.com/TauferLab/ANACIN-X/wiki/Visualization#benchmark-application-data-visualization) for more information on locating what arguments to pass to visualization scripts and on what they output.

If you have access to Jupyter Notebooks, you can visualize kernel distance and callstack data using the Jupyter Notebook titled 'visualization.ipynb'.  Open it through Jupyter and follow the prompts to generate your figures.

If you will visualize provided sample kernel distance data, run the following command from the root of your project.

```

Ou    Output file to store the visualization in, excluding the file type (e.g., output_file or kdts_visualization)
```

If you will visualize kernel distance data from a benchmark application using the command line, run the following command from the root of your project.

```

NDPl  Lowest percentage of message non-determinism used in decimal format
NDPs  The message non-determinism percent step size in decimal format
NDPh  Highest percent of message non-determinism used in decimal format

Options:
--nd_neighbor_fraction NDPt  Used only for visualizations of unstructured mesh data to identiy the topological non-determinism percent in decimal format
```

If you will visualize callstack data from a benchmark application using the command line, run the following commands from the root of your project.

**Important**: In the second command below, the file apps/comm\_pattern\_generator/build/comm\_pattern\_generator is an executable file for your project.  Be sure that you run the below commands on KDTS data that was generated from the same executable file as what you input below!

```
python3 anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/anomaly_detection.py KDTS anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/anomaly_detection_policies/all.json -o flagged_indices.pkl

Positional Arguments:
KDTS  Kernel distance time series file

python3 anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/callstack_analysis.py FI KDTS apps/comm_pattern_generator/build/comm_pattern_generator

Positional Arguments:
FI    Flagged indices pickle file produced by by 'anomaly_detection.py (will have the same path as kdts.pkl file)
KDTS  Kernel distance time series file

python3 anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/visualization/visualize_callstack_report.py AR --plot_type="bar_chart"

Positional Arguments:
AR    Anomaly report file with same path as kdts.pkl file (i.e., 'non_anomaly_report_for_policy_all.txt')
```

### Visualizing External Application Data
	
If you're visualizing data from an external application (i.e., not one of the provided three benchmark applications), use the following collection of commands to visualize data.

If you're generating a kdts visualization, run the following command from within the directory 'anacin-x/event_graph_analysis'.

```
python3 visualization/visualize_kernel_distance_time_series.py KDTS --plot_type=box

Positional Arguments
KDTS  Kernel distance time series file (Can be found in the directory that stores all your run directories.)
```

This will create the visualization file titled 'kernel_distance_time_series.png' within the directory you're currently in.

If you're visualizing callstack data, do so with the following commands from within the root directory of your project.

```
python3 anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/anomaly_detection.py KDTS anacin-x/event_graph_analysis/anomaly_detection_policies/all.json -o flagged_indices.pkl

Positional Arguments:
KDTS  Kernel distance time series file
